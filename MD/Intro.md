## Assessing performance is hard!

- Quantifying performance requires careful consideration of **measurement scales**. Are there ML equivalents of physical units? 
- What we can observe is rarely of direct interest. The most important performance indicators are **latent**! 
- Ultimately empirical ML needs to make **causal** (or counterfactual) statements:

> Algorithm A outperformed algorithm B **because** the classes were highly imbalanced.
